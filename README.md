# FreeCodeCamp Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum Labs Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the labs in FreeCodeCamp's brand new [**Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/).

FreeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization and community that provides free, interactive coding lessons and resources to help people learn to code and build websites.

These solutions follow the **KISS** principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid), ensuring that:

- All code is beginner-friendly.
- Concepts used are limited strictly to what has already been covered in the course so far.
- There are no shortcuts or leaps into advanced topics prematurely.

Itâ€™s highly recommended to attempt solving the labs on your own first. Use these solutions as a reference or for guidance.
